    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    
    <p>I am Ladarrius Ward,25 years old, born and raised in Memphis, Tn. I am the oldest of three on my mother's side and
        middle child on my father's side totalling eight siblings. I graduated from MASE High School in 2017 abd immediately left for the Army a week later. 
        I completed five eventful years in the military and moved back home to follow my own goals and passions. </p>
    
    <p>I am aiming to become a true profitable Forex Trader out of Memphis. I wouldnt't consider that a career per say, but alongside that goal I do have a dream.
    I want to be able to translate my methods of trading into an algorhithm that actually works and provide it to those who need that extra push to make a living in this economy without 
    over-leveraging themselves to make ends meet. That is my ultimate end goal and why I believe this course can give me the stepping stones to make it happen.</p>
    
    <p>My favorite food would have to be almost anything chicken, but I will have to say specifically chicken wings.</p>
